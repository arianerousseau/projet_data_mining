# projet_data_mining

This project was realised by Ariane Rousseau and Capucine Foucher.

In the github repository you can find the source code as well as the dataset "wdbc" in the csv format.
The source code is our streamlit app "app.py" that we coded in python using the streamlit library.

If you don't have a virtual environement already installed on your machine, please create one using the following command so that the streamlit app can work :

- pip install virtualenv
- virtualenv myenv
- source myenv/bin/activate
- pip install streamlit
- pip install "the necessary libraries"

Enjoy our work ! We pourred our hearts into it ! <3
